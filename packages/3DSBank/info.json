    "details": "3DSBank moves the 'Nintendo 3DS' folder to 'SD://3DSBank/SlotN', this making it possible to use additional 'Nintendo 3DS' folders. This is useful if you want to install more than 300 titles in the HOME menu - so you can easily switch between slots at any time (e.g. one slot for normal games and one for VC injects). More than 300 titles do not appear in the HOME menu. So that the whole thing works, the homebrew runs in DS mode of the 3DS.",
