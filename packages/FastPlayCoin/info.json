  "description": "Sets your Play Coins to 300",
  "details": "This is a fork of PlayCoin (The CIA Version). The only difference is it automatically adds 300 play coins without waiting for user input, then it exits. I just think it's silly to have a menu to deal with when most users probably just want to max out their play coins.\\n\\nUsage:\\n- Allows to modify the 3DS's Play Coins counter, in other words providing infinite Play Coins.\\n- Usage is self-explanatory, just open the app and wait for your 300 coins. No more than 300 coins can be held at a time, this is a system limit.",
