  "details": "TWLSaveTool is a 3DS homebrew that allows you to read, write, and erase save files from NDS cartridges (just like savegame-manager!)\\n\\nThe CIA build requires an access to CFWs. If it's the case, this is the best option; you'll be able to see the awesome banner Apache Thunder made üòâ.\\n\\nThe 3dsx build requires you to have either Pok√©Transporter or Pok√©mon Dream Radar installed on your 3DS. In both cases you'll need to pay to be able to download them.\\n\\nCompatibility list:\\nAll games except WarioWare D.I.Y., Band Brothers DX, Art Academy DS, and Pok√©mon Typing Adventure should be supported.\\n\\n",
